      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
        I am a 20-year-old third-year student at the Technological University of
        <br />
        Manila, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems. I have
        <br />
        gained proficiency in programming languages like C++, C, and Java,
        <br />
        building a solid foundation in software development and problem-solving.
        <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to my programming knowledge, I have experience in <br />
        prototyping applications using FIGMA, which gives me an idea on how to
        <br />
        effectively design and visualize user interfaces. This combination of
        <br />
        technical skills and design understanding equips me to tackle diverse
        <br />
        challenges in the field of information systems. I am eager to apply my
        <br />
        learning in practical settings and contribute to innovative projects.
        <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        While I have a foundational understanding of the programming languages I
        <br />
        use, I’m motivated to deepen my knowledge through hands-on projects. I
        <br />
        believe that continuous learning and practice will enhance my skills,
        <br />
        enabling me to handle complex challenges and contribute to team projects
        <br />
        effectively. My goal is to develop strong expertise for a successful
        <br />
        career in information systems.
